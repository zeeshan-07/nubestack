In the 5G era, ultra-low latency and high throughput are essential. Traditional virtualized networks can't keep up. **Nubestack NFV Solutions** use advanced technologies to deliver near bare-metal network performance in the cloud. We integrate high-speed data plane acceleration so your network functions handle demanding traffic with minimal latency and maximum efficiency.

## What Is Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)?

**NFV** replaces proprietary network hardware (routers, firewalls, load balancers) with software running on standard servers. The challenge: eliminating virtualization overhead. By leveraging **SR-IOV, DPDK, and OVN**, Nubestack enables virtualized network functions (VNFs) to achieve the speed and efficiency required for modern Telco and cloud-native workloads.

## Real-World Example: High-Performance Virtual Router

A service provider needs virtual routers for vCPE, each handling gigabit-speed connections. Standard Linux bridges can't keep up. With Nubestack:
- **SR-IOV** gives VMs direct access to NICs, slashing I/O latency
- **DPDK** enables user-space packet processing at millions of packets/sec
- **OVN** provides scalable, programmable overlays and security
Result: Each virtual router delivers line-rate performance, supporting more customers with less hardware and lower latency.
