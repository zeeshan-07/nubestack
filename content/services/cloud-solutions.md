## What Are Private/Public Cloud Solutions?


**Private Cloud:** Dedicated, secure, and customizable—hosted on-premises or by a trusted provider. Platforms like **OpenStack** (IaaS) and **OpenShift** (PaaS) deliver full control and compliance.

**Public Cloud:** Scalable, pay-as-you-go services from **AWS, Azure, GCP**—ideal for rapid innovation and reducing infrastructure overhead.

**Hybrid & Multi-Cloud:** Combine private and public clouds for maximum agility. Run workloads where they fit best, with seamless management and connectivity across all platforms.

## Real-World Example: Financial Services Hybrid Cloud


**Example: Financial Services Hybrid Cloud**
A bank must keep sensitive data on-premises for compliance, but wants public cloud agility for development and customer apps. Nubestack delivers:
- **OpenStack** private cloud for secure, compliant data and transactions
- **AWS** for scalable, customer-facing web/mobile platforms
- **OpenShift** for unified app deployment across both clouds
- Secure networking, identity, and cost optimization spanning all environments
This hybrid model ensures compliance and security, while enabling rapid innovation and scalability.
