As enterprises increasingly adopt cloud technologies, **data sovereignty and compliance** have become critical concerns. Organizations must ensure that **sensitive data remains within specific geographic or regulatory boundaries** while still enabling modern cloud workloads.  

NubeStack helps enterprises address these challenges by provisioning **on-prem Ceph storage clusters**, allowing **public and private workloads to access data securely** without ever leaving the organization’s premises.

## Understanding Data Sovereignty Challenges

Cloud adoption brings numerous benefits, but also introduces **data governance and compliance risks**:  

- **Regulatory compliance:** Laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, and industry-specific mandates require strict control over where and how data is stored.  
- **Cross-border restrictions:** Certain countries mandate that sensitive data cannot leave national borders.  
- **Vendor lock-in concerns:** Using public cloud storage exclusively can reduce visibility and control over critical data.  
- **Security and privacy risks:** Transferring data to third-party clouds may expose it to breaches or unauthorized access.  
- **Hybrid cloud complexity:** Balancing workloads across public, private, and on-prem resources while ensuring compliance is challenging.  


## NubeStack’s Solution: On-Prem Ceph Clusters

NubeStack enables organizations to **retain full control over their data** by deploying **highly available and scalable Ceph storage clusters on-premises**. This ensures that data **never leaves your premises**, while still enabling cloud-native workloads and hybrid deployments.

### Key Capabilities:

1. **On-Prem Ceph Deployment**
   - Enterprise-grade, scalable, and redundant storage  
   - Supports block, object, and file storage for diverse workloads  
   - Integrated with existing private cloud or virtualization infrastructure  

2. **Secure Access for Hybrid Workloads**
   - Public or private workloads can access on-prem Ceph storage via secure APIs  
   - Supports containerized workloads with Kubernetes or OpenStack integration  
   - Data remains in your environment; no replication to external cloud unless explicitly configured  

3. **Compliance and Governance**
   - Meets regulatory and organizational requirements for data sovereignty  
   - Enables fine-grained RBAC, encryption at rest, and secure audit trails  
   - Ensures full visibility and control over data location and access  

4. **Flexible Hybrid Cloud Integration**
   - Workloads can burst to public cloud while using on-prem data safely  
   - Enables hybrid cloud models without violating data residency requirements  
   - Supports automated provisioning and orchestration for consistent deployments
